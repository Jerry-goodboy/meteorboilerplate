meteorboilerplate
============

Just a basic bootstrap-3 meteor layout with admin roles and user admin

I used book.discovermeteor.com and various bootstrap-3 packages to create a basic boilerplate app.

App includes:

  * bootstrap-3
  * iron-router
  * iron-router-progress
  * roles
  * accounts-entry
  * accounts-admin-ui-bootstrap-3
  * blog

Todos:

  * working contact us page
  * Upgrade to latest meteor release with new view 
  * generic terms and privicy policy with links in footer

NOTES:

There is a siteconfig.js file in lib that contains a rudamentary way to store some site information, I created some handlebar helpers for the fields.

Have worked on a changes on the accounts-entry side. They have added two new settings for setting email and username to lowercase. Once that is released I will update this readme.
